Pull requests are welcome. For now, we are building using the latest version of Visual Studio. 
The project uses vcpkg to reference Google Tests, after which all the tests can be built and run inside Visual Studio.
Running the tests takes about 5 seconds.

Please include appropriate unit tests with your PRs. Follow the naming style in existing tests, where
tests use very discriptive names and have a single-purpose.
